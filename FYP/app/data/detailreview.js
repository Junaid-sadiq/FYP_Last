      "The location and the host are really great, but I was worried about safety and cleanliness because it seems that it is not registered as a lodging company in the country. Of course nothing happened!",

      "The location is so good! It was very convenient because it was right in front of Karahi  Seaview. However, it was a high-rise building, so it was difficult to ventilate the windows because there was an air conditioner on the ceiling in the room, so I think you can use the air purifier mode. It was a cozy place! I have a return visit",

      "When you enter the room, it seems to be a very attractive place with a window that you can see right in front of your eyes. The shower and bathroom were also warm to the floor, so it wasn't cold. There were also many restaurants in the shopping district under the building, and I think I was able to take a good rest without any shortcomings.",

      "The location is perfect and there is a separate space to leave your luggage, so let's relax! The heating worked well and the water pressure was great!! They responded quickly and took care of the necessary parts in advance, so there was no need to ask any questions! I want to use it the next time I travel!!",

      "The location was very close to Gangnam Station, so it was easy to move around, and there were many convenience facilities and cafes and restaurants nearby. When entering the floor, there was one more door through which the password was passed, so it felt like a safe accommodation. There was a lot of floating people even at night, so it was easy to move around. I liked that the accommodation was very clean and there were basic hair dryers, toothbrushes, razors, etc. The outside view is sunny and good, but the building in front is currently under construction, so the construction noise is very little! All the bedding and floors were clean and the hot water was also good. The host explained it well, so it was easy to use the accommodation.",

      "First of all, the location of the accommodation was very good because it was right near the station, and the inside of the accommodation was smaller than expected for two people, but overall it was clean. However, there was a part that was a little frustrating because it was a small house with all glass, and it was noisy from early in the morning because it was under construction right next door..! check-in",
